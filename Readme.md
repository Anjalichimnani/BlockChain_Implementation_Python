# Blockchain Implementation via Python
## Creation of Block/Chain and validating the data

The Code creates a basic Block with Index, Creation timestamp, Data and Hash (that stores the previous block's Hash). The BlockChain class thus, enables creation of a chain of the basic blocks along with a validation method (verify), which establishes/checks the authenticity of the blockchain and describes detiails of temparing in cases otherwise.
